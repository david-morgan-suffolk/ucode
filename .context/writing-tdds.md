# Writing Technical Design Documents (TDDs)

Instructions for any design document written in this repo.
Read this file in full before writing a TDD, and follow it exactly.

You are writing a Technical Design Document (TDD).
The TDD will be reviewed by a human and then handed to a coding agent for implementation.
Its job is to pin down every decision that crosses a contract boundary, and to stay silent on everything the implementer can decide for itself.

**Placement and lifecycle:**
Write the TDD to `.context/active/YYYYMMDD-<doc-title>.md`, dated the day you create it.
A TDD lives only as long as its implementation.
The PR that completes the work deletes the TDD.

You are to use language in the style of Simplified Technical English:

- Active voice. The component that acts is the subject of the sentence.
  ("The launcher execs the agent," not "the agent is exec'd.")
- One instruction or fact per sentence. Keep sentences under ~20 words.
- State behavior positively. Say what the system does before what it forbids.
- No gerund/participle chains as nouns.
  Prefer "discover models" over "the discovery of models" / "model discovery processing."
- Noun clusters max 3 words. Break up "gateway-bound provider service resolution result."
- One term per concept, every time — see the glossary below. Never vary a defined term for style.

You are to avoid elements of style in your language - what's a virtue in prose is a defect in a TDD.

**Sizing gate (apply BEFORE writing):**
One TDD = one independently shippable and revertable unit of work.
If the architecture diagram would need more than ~6 components, or the doc would need more than 3–4 sequence diagrams, or any diagram cannot be drawn in simple ASCII — the scope is too big or too low-level.
Stop and propose a split into multiple TDDs instead of writing one.

**Structure (use these sections, in order):**

1. **Context & Problem** — 2–4 sentences on what exists today and what's broken or missing.

2. **Goals** — bulleted, measurable where possible.

3. **Non-Goals & Forbidden Approaches** — two explicit lists:
   - _Non-goals_: scope this design will not address.
   - _Forbidden approaches_: solutions the implementer must NOT use, even where they seem natural (e.g. "do not read `os.environ` in a domain module", "do not clobber the user's config file", "do not add a new dependency").
     Include the common/obvious approach if it was considered and rejected.

4. **Requirements** — the constraints driving the design.
   Each requirement must be unambiguous (one possible reading) and verifiable (a finite check could confirm it).

5. **Invariants** — statements that must be true before AND after this work ships (backward compatibility guarantees, data integrity rules, idempotency properties).
   These constrain every implementation decision, including ones this doc doesn't anticipate.

6. **Proposed Architecture** — prose description supported by a C4 Container-level diagram in plain ASCII.
   One sentence per component stating its responsibility.

7. **Key Interactions** — sequence diagrams in plain ASCII for the 2–4 flows that exercise the most architectural surface.

8. **Data Model** — entities, relationships, key access patterns.
   Schema sketches are fine; full DDL is not.

9. **APIs / Interfaces** — endpoint/interface names, methods, and purpose.
   No request/response schemas or signatures UNLESS the type itself is a contract decision — i.e. if the implementer chose a different shape, the PR would be rejected.
   Those types must be pinned here exactly.

10. **Behavior & Domain Rules** — each business rule stated once in prose, then anchored with 1–3 concrete worked examples (inputs → expected outcome), always including the ugliest edge case.
    Examples are normative: if prose and example conflict, the example wins and the doc must be fixed.

11. **Acceptance Criteria** — observable, contract-level checks that define "done".
    Written so they can be turned directly into tests.
    If the work is large, group criteria into ordered milestones; each milestone is a verification gate the implementation must pass before proceeding.

12. **Cross-Cutting Concerns** — auth, observability, error handling, etc.
    One short paragraph each, only where this design deviates from or adds to repo conventions.
    Don't restate what AGENTS.md already covers.

13. **Reference Implementations** — pointers to existing files/modules in the repo whose patterns the implementer should imitate, one line each (e.g. "config writes: follow src/ucode/config_io.py").

14. **Alternatives Considered** — bulleted, one line each, with the chosen option and a half-sentence on why.
    Link an ADR if the justification needs more.

15. **Halt Conditions** — anything unresolved goes here, phrased as an explicit instruction: "If implementation touches X, stop and ask before proceeding."
    No ambient open questions; every item is either resolved before handoff or converted into a halt condition.

**Style constraints:**

- Avoid the `Elegant variation` antipattern:
  Use one token per concept and use it identically every time.
  Do not give the same concept many names, and one name for many concepts:
  "final wiki placement" / "final pages" / "page metadata" / PageMetadata / "planned target page metadata" / "target page metadata" / "planned page metadata" / "planned target page."
  Likewise "route hint" appears as "route hints," "legacy route hints," "metadata-only hint," "route rationale," and "source-plan route rationale."
  Each rename forces the reviewer to decide is this a new thing or the same thing?
- Follow the `No undefined terms` rule:
  Define terms before use in a glossary in the **Context & Problem** section.
- Avoid the `Stacked negation` antipattern: do not negate already negative concepts:
  "Do not leave unsupported config as supported"
  "Tests prove no writer emits a secret into a committed config file."
- Stop `Specification by prohibition` abuse:
  "Halt Conditions", "Non-Goals & Forbidden Approaches" - these should be used only when they stop the agent from making specific mistakes or choosing valid-looking but inappropriate design decisions based on it's reading of the TDD.
  The TDD must be self-contained - don't make it a conversation summary of a conversation that happened in chat.
  If you need to refer to outside context, use a normative markdown link to a document.
  Be selective, targeted and precise.
- Avoid `Weak words and uncalibrated modals` antipattern:
  "Relevant provider services" (relevant by what test?).
  "token when available" (available when? decided by whom?)
  "may show cached models" (must|can|may|cannot are used colloquially)
  Each require interpretation and must be banned as "weak phrases" that punt a hidden decision to the reader.
- Avoid `Nominalization and hidden actors` antipattern:
  No abstract nouns doing actions: "discovery," "resolution," "synthesis," "placement," "ingestion," "validation" - unqualified, these are "zombie nouns" and oppose the rule that characters should be subjects and actions should be verbs.
  When combined with the agentless passive ("config must be applied only through a validated writer" — applied by what?), the reviewer cannot answer the basic spec question: which component is responsible for which behavior.
  Compound-noun pile-ups make it worse: "provider service resolution target set," "validated config artifact named settings.json scoped to workspace id."
- Avoid `Redundancy across sections` antipattern:
  "Do not read `os.environ` in `agents/<name>.py`" (§3), "must not read ambient env or write outside the config writer" (§6), "Halt if a module must read env for launch to proceed" (§15).
  The one-writer rule and the additive-config rule each appear in Goals, Requirements, Invariants, Behavior Rules, and Acceptance Criteria.
  Because the restatements drift in wording, the reviewer can't tell whether §11 is derived from §4 or adds new constraints, so they must diff five sections against each other. That cross-checking is pure extraneous load.
- Avoid the `non-parallel enumerations` antipattern:
  "ConfigError records a missing token, an unreachable gateway, a malformed file, and provider drift" — four items at four different levels of abstraction (an absence, a network state, a parse fault, a category).
  The reader hunts for the organizing principle and finds none, which is its own small tax repeated throughout the lists.
- All diagrams are plain ASCII.
  If something can't be expressed in a simple ASCII diagram, it is too low-level for this document — omit it or escalate via the sizing gate.
- No pseudocode, no implementation snippets, no function signatures — except public contract types per section 9.
- State technology choices as decisions, not arguments.
  "Uses `typer`" — not three paragraphs comparing it to `argparse`.
  If a choice needs justification, write a one-line ADR pointer.
- Hard cap: ~300 lines.
  If a section would exceed half a page, ask whether to split it into a separate doc or ADR rather than expanding inline.
- Write for an engineer who already knows the stack.
  Don't explain what `uv`, `typer`, or Databricks AI Gateway is.
- Prefer prose for design rationale; bullets for enumerable lists.
- Editing pass before finishing: delete any sentence describing HOW to build something rather than WHAT must be true.
  The test for inclusion: "if the implementer decided this differently, would the PR be rejected?"
  If no, cut it.

**Pinning a contract type (section 9):**

Pin a type only when its shape is itself the contract — a different shape would fail
review. Use Python type declarations: a `@dataclass`, a `Protocol`, a type alias, or a
typed function signature. Do not paste an implementation body.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class ProviderService:
    name: str
    provider_type: str          # e.g. "databricks", "bedrock"
    base_url: str

# Discriminated result: a different set of literals fails review.
ValidateResult = Literal["ok", "auth-failed", "gateway-unreachable", "missing"]

def resolve_provider_service(
    workspace: str,
    model: str,
) -> ProviderService: ...        # raises ConfigError; never returns None

class ToolConfigWriter(Protocol):
    # Additive-only: merges into existing config, never clobbers user keys.
    def write_tool_config(self, spec: ToolSpec, dest: Path) -> None: ...
```

Everything else — helper functions, control flow, private attributes — the implementer
decides. Pin the boundary, stay silent on the interior.
